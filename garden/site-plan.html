        [When you can go to the grocery store and easily get the food you need for yourself and your family why would you want to garden.  With many options and endless information on different gardening techniques how do you choose the best method for your situation?  Over the course of the past ten years I have tried many gardening techiniques and found two techniques that have improved my gardening satisfaction immensely.  Those two gardening techniques are Hugelkultur and No Dig gardening.  These two methods can work together or employed individually to create beautiful and productive gardens.
        There are many options and alternatives in the gardening worlds that you can become overwhelmed.  I would like to provide two tested options that will provide you with a lifetime of enjoyment and satisfaction in your gardening pursuits. ]

      <h3>[Huglekutur]</h3>
      <p>
        [Hügelkultur, pronounced hoo-gul-culture, is a gardening technique that originated in Germany. The word means hill culture. Herrman Andrä is the botanist that is credited introducing this method.  This is a type of gardening where you create raised hill beds made of compostable materials atop large logs. This creates a nutrient-rich mound that you can sow plants into. Since the mounds create nutrients and retain moisture, it is an efficient, low-labor, and sustainable gardening method once your mounds are built.  Since logs take longer to break down, they will provide a natural supply of nutrients to your plants over the years.
        If you have ever heard of a no-dig garden, this is the same principle. The difference is that with a no-dig garden, you still have to supply fresh woodchips each year to encourage continuous composting.
        With a Hügelkultur garden, the logs keep breaking down year after year, thus releasing more nutrients to the surrounding area. In fact, if you have hardwoods like oaks, maples, or apples around, use those as your Hügelkultur base logs. A large one can take up to 20 years to decompose, which means that you will not have to add any extra fertilizer for a good couple of decades.]

      <h3>[No Dig]</h3>
      <p>
        [No dig gardening also referred to as “Back to Eden” gardening is the process of gardening without digging or tilling the ground.  There are many benefits to this type of gardening.  The primary benefits are ease on the body, water retention, weed suppression and soil development.  Once established the no dig garden will increase yields without the need of chemical fertilizers.  The no dig garden is also a better choice for water conservation.   
        Once you have chosen the location, it is time to prepare the ground and soil. If you are transforming an existing garden space, then you don’t require any additional preparation. However, for hard surfaces and rocky ground, you will have to first lay down branches, twigs and dry leaves at the height of at least 4 inches. Similarly, for a no dig garden over lawn grass, mowing the grass first is a crucial step. Next, you can add nitrogen fertilizer to allow the grass to rot down after it is buried under a layer of mulch.
        Mulch is commonly described as organic matter that is layered on top of the soil rather than mixing it with the soil. It helps the soil in retaining moisture while improving fertility and aeration. For no dig gardening, you will have to spread 5 inches of mulch over the soil.  You can also use a combination of mulch and straw to facilitate the process of breaking down.]
