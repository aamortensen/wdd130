  <p>Greetings from Spokane, Washington.  Spokane is located in the beautiful Pacific NW.  
    I'm a life time resident and hope to never move from here.  My wife and I have been married for 24yrs 
    and have five beautiful children ranging in age from 20-5yrs of age.</p>
  <p>I'm a convert to the church. I joined the church 25 years ago.  The church remains one of the greatest 
    blessings in my life.  The gospel has saved my life in multiple ways and on multiple occasions.</p>
    <p>I an xray tech and team lead for the past 15 years.  I can't invision myself doing this 
      for the next 20 years so I decided to go back to school and go in a direction that would allow me to 
      work from home.  I am not technologically savy and this has been a stressful but exciting experience.  
      I enjoy learning and stretching myself.  I look forward to learning and growing with you.</p>
